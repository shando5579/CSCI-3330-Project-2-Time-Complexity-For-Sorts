# CSCI-3330-Project-2-Time-Complexity-For-Sorts
In computer science, the [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.
## About
This is a Python project put together by Shandon Probst, Grant Fugate, and Nickolas Paternoster and a testing process that analysis the time complexities of sorting algorithms.
The project was designed for Dr. Chenyi Hu's CSCI 3330 Algorithms course, in which we were to design and implement a testing suite that would record times for each sort as our second project in the course.
## Installation
Simply download all files and place within the directory from which you plan to run the main file (**front_end.py**) from.
